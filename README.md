### Sales vs. Predicted Sales
#### Analysis:
This visualization compares the **actual sales** versus the **predicted sales** generated by the machine learning model. The model predicts sales based on various features such as marketing spend, customer count, temperature, and whether there were holidays or events on that day.

#### Business Implication:
- **Prediction Accuracy**: This comparison is key to understanding the model's performance. If the predicted and actual sales align well, the business can use this model with confidence for future sales forecasting.
- **Adjusting Strategies**: If the model performs poorly (with large discrepancies), it indicates the need for **further model improvements**, additional features, or more accurate data.

### Marketing Spend Efficiency
#### Analysis:
This bar chart shows **Marketing Spend per Customer**, providing insights into how much is spent on marketing to attract each customer. This is calculated by dividing **Marketing Spend** by **Customer Count**.

#### Business Implication:
- **Optimization of Marketing Budget**: By analyzing the marketing efficiency across different periods or stores, businesses can identify which marketing strategies yield the best ROI.
- **Targeted Campaigns**: Focus marketing resources on periods or regions with higher marketing efficiency, while reducing spend in less efficient areas.
